CLC
===

A trivial Command Line Calculator.

I live on the command line and get bored of funky syntax starting and
stopping python or passing commands to evaluate and print basic
math. This script takes its command line arguments and evaluates them.

    $ ./clc.py 5*4
    > 20

Intended to be symlinked as a script

    $ clc 5*4
    > 20
